TECHNOLOGIES USED IN FRAMEWORK:

* I decided to use for current project Selenide, not Selenium, since last one has couple of key drawbacks
(let's say - features): developers need to write some boilerplate code to create/shutdown webdriver,
to search radio buttons, to wait for javascript interactions, etc. Selenide API is higher-level,
but it was designed specifically for UI- and Acceptance testing. For mode details - visit link below

* Intellj IDEA
* Maven
